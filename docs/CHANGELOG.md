# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Documented installation and run steps in README and development guide.
- Added Test Reports and UAT sections mapping URS to test specs in `docs/04-test.md`.
- Added architecture flowchart, module interaction sequence, and ERD/API tables to `docs/02-design.md` with references across docs.
- Expanded `docs/03-dev.md` with build/test/release commands and detailed CI/CD workflow.
- Introduced `release-and-tests.yml` for tag-driven builds with tiered testing and release behavior.
- Added [`jest.setup.js`](../jest.setup.js) to stub Canvas APIs in jsdom tests (supports T-1, T-3).

### Changed
- Overhauled `release-and-tests.yml` to parse tag phases via a meta job, build once, and run phase-specific tests and releases.
- Clarified documentation across requirements, design, development, and testing guides.
- Refined URS entries to center player or developer perspectives and remove implementation hints (URS-006, URS-012, URS-015, URS-016, URS-021, URS-022).
- Refined FR-030 to focus on observable NPC behavior and moved spawn timing, speed, and frame-count details to design specs (DS-10, DS-25, DS-27, DS-30).
- Refactored `update-version.mjs` to export `RELEASE_VERSION`, `BUILD_NUMBER`, and `GIT_SHA`, support CI env variables, and update HTML/manifest using a single source of truth.
- Ensured `update-version.mjs` injects globals through `version.global.js` and consolidates HTML replacements (DS-16, T-16).
- CI workflows run `node scripts/update-version.mjs` before tests and releases to keep `version.js`, `version.global.js`, `index.html`, and `manifest.json` in sync (DS-16, T-16).
- Test workflow derives the release version from `package.json` and updates version info without build metadata before running tests (DS-16, T-16).
- Separated build metadata from the base version, introducing `window.__APP_BUILD_META__` and keeping `window.__APP_VERSION__` free of `+build` suffixes (DS-15, T-15).
- Clarified step naming in test workflow to highlight version.js and HTML/manifest updates (DS-16, T-16).
- Condensed version information in README for brevity.
- Organized root by moving test files into `tests/` and relocating orientation and layout utilities to `src/ui/`.

### Fixed
- Corrected release version derivation step in test workflow to use a multi-line bash block, preventing shell syntax errors (DS-16, T-16).
- Refactored `update-version.mjs` to generate `version.js` (exports only) and `version.global.js` (browser globals), resolving commit SHAs solely from environment variables and defaulting to `devsha` when absent (DS-16, T-16).
- Limited `update-version.mjs` to `BUILD_NUMBER` and `GIT_SHA` env vars, avoiding unintended GitHub defaults during local tests (DS-16, T-16).
