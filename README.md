# Mario Demo


**Version: 2.20.4**

This project is a simple platformer demo inspired by classic 2D side-scrollers. A brief **HPC Games** splash fades in on a black screen before revealing the home page, whose title now uses a large, stylized font that scales to fit smaller screens for stronger visual impact. The splash overlay disables pointer events, scales with the viewport, and is removed on initialization even if its animation already finished, preventing it from blocking the start page on slow connections. The home screen shows a resource loading progress bar before gameplay begins, preloading sprites and audio so sounds are ready once the game starts. The stage clear screen includes a simple star animation effect, sliding triggers a brief dust animation, and stomping an NPC now spawns a small star at the point of impact for visual feedback. Canvas scaling now listens to visual viewport changes so dust effects stay aligned when Safari's address bar hides on iPhone. A one-minute countdown timer adds urgency. When time runs out before reaching the goal, a fail screen with a restart option appears. Pedestrian lights cycle through green (3s), blink (2s), and red (4s) phases, and nearby characters wait during red. When stopped by a red light, OL, Officeman, and Student NPCs play dedicated idle animations from their sprite sets. Traffic lights are non-solid and cannot be stood on. Background graphics rebuild using the canvas's full height to preserve source resolution in fullscreen. Fullscreen uses centered letterboxing with black bars and automatic canvas resize, and entering fullscreen via the root container resizes the stage correctly with centered letterboxing. Stage 1-1 now spawns OL, Student, and Officeman NPCs with equal frequency. A new Trunk NPC occasionally rolls in from the left, moving faster than OL and always passing harmlessly through the player, even after landing; its walk animation displays correctly without blocking movement and uses image smoothing to preserve sprite detail when enlarged. The trunk's movement now kicks up a slide-like dust effect and it renders above all other characters to stay visible. Trunk NPCs ignore red lights so their walk animation never disappears near traffic signals. OL NPCs walk fastest, Officemen move at a medium pace, and Students walk more slowly; all walk animations cycle through every sprite frame for smoother motion. Student and Officeman NPCs use an 11-frame walk sequence for added fluidity, and Officeman sprites render 1.25× larger while Trunk sprites render 1.1× larger and two tiles lower from their centers with a wider shadow offset one tile upward for alignment, without changing collision boxes. NPCs now spawn at their normal size even if the player is sliding. NPCs entering from the right no longer stick at the stage start and vanish once their left edge touches the screen, left-spawned NPCs land correctly on the ground when the camera is at the starting position, and automatic spawns handle missing option objects without crashing. Touch buttons are circular and pinned to the bottom screen corners for easier reach. NPC and player collision boxes now span exactly one tile width for consistent interactions, while the player sprite narrows when idle without shrinking its collision box. The **SDS** in `docs/02-design.md` details asset preloading, input queuing, game-loop ordering, friction and collision formulas, NPC state machines, rendering culls, service worker messaging, and i18n dictionary updates for easier maintenance.
During gameplay, the HUD displays the player's live score, current stage label, and a countdown timer to track progress. A developer toggle in the settings gear reveals a debug panel, log controls, an NPC spawn panel with **NPC1**/**NPC2** buttons that spawn properly proportioned NPCs, and level editor tools for developers and testers.

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Run

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or rebuild version info and serve the directory with a static server:

```sh
npm run build && npx serve .
```

## Audio

Sound effects in `assets/sounds` are sourced from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets) and are used as follows:

- `jump.wav` – played when the player jumps or bounces off an NPC.
- `impact.wav` – previously played when hitting a brick from below.
- `slide.wav` – played when initiating a slide.
- `clear.wav` – played upon clearing the stage.
- `coin.wav` – played when collecting a coin.
- `fail.wav` – played when the timer expires and the stage is failed.

Background music (`assets/music/background.wav`) plays in a loop when the game starts. Use the **BGM** control in the top-right corner of the screen to mute or unmute it.

## Configuration

Stage objects are defined in `assets/objects.custom.js` (or `assets/objects.js` if the custom file is missing) as a JavaScript module. Each entry in the array looks like:

```js
{ type: 'brick', x: 12, y: 4, transparent: true }
```

Supported `type` values are `brick`, `coin`, and `light`. The `x` and `y` fields use tile coordinates. The optional `transparent` flag (default `false`) renders an object at 50% opacity without changing its collision behavior. A `collision` array like `[1,1,0,0]` can define sub-tile patterns (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) on the 24px collision grid. `createGameState` loads this file to populate the level, coins, and traffic lights.

## Level Editor (developer/tester only)

Open the settings menu and use the **LEVEL** controls to enable design mode. This editor is intended for developers and testers; the canvas gains a dashed outline while active and the countdown timer pauses. Click or tap an object to select it, drag it to a new tile, then release to drop it. Click the selected object again to clear the selection. Disabling design mode clears the current selection. The transparency toggle affects only the current selection; clicking it with nothing selected has no effect. The layout can be saved as JSON for editing.
While an object is selected, you can move it one tile at a time with the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys for up, left, down, and right nudges respectively.
Press `Q` to cycle a selected 24px block through quadrants clockwise.
When enabled, an **新增** button appears to place a 24px collision block centered below the HUD. Design mode also outlines collision boxes for all objects, the player, and NPCs in green to aid placement.

## Testing

Run the test suite after installing dependencies:

```sh
npm test
```
The test suite uses a jsdom environment with a stubbed Canvas context from [`jest.setup.js`](./jest.setup.js) and currently reports **42 passed suites (232 tests)** with coverage **84 % statements, 76 % branches, 84 % functions, 88 % lines**. Continuous integration runs the same command on each push. Detailed reports and UAT results are documented in `docs/04-test.md`.

## Versioning

Run `npm run build` to regenerate `version.js`, `version.global.js`, and cache-busting query strings. The script prioritizes the `RELEASE_VERSION` environment variable (stripping an optional leading `v`) and falls back to `package.json` when absent. It records `BUILD_NUMBER` and the first seven characters of `GIT_SHA`, defaulting to `devsha` when unspecified. `version.js` exports these constants, while `version.global.js` imports them to set `window.__APP_VERSION__ = v<RELEASE_VERSION>` and an optional `window.__APP_BUILD_META__ = build.<run>.<sha7>`. `index.html` loads `version.global.js` via a `<script type="module">` tag.

## Documentation

Project documentation is stored in the `docs/` directory. Each file is curated for its specific role so requirements, design, development, and tests remain in sync:

- `docs/01-requirement.md` – URS, SRS (FR/NFR), and RTM
- `docs/02-design.md` – SAD (with architecture diagram), SDS, ICD (module sequence & data tables), ERD, API, ADR, and UX
- `docs/03-dev.md` – development guide, coding standards, and CI/CD
- `docs/04-test.md` – test plan/specs/reports and UAT
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` – version history
